# Deep Blue
> Deep Blue is the progression of my previous project the [indeed-scraper](https://github.com/krampus-nuggets/indeed-scraper) which was purely python based. The [indeed-scraper](https://github.com/krampus-nuggets/indeed-scraper) however could not scrape JavaScript heavy websites and thus Deep Blue was created.

### Getting Started
Clone the repository to your device:
`git clone https://github.com/krampus-nuggets/deep-blue.git`

Then enter the the deep-blue directory:
`cd deep-blue`

Install the dependencies/packages:
`npm install`


### Test Scraper

Replace **url** within **scraper.js** with the Example Link/URL
![Replace <url>](https://zdcohumppa-github-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/deep-blue/replaceURL.png)

Then in your terminal run the following, whilst in the project root directory:
`node scraper.js`
